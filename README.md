Custom Post Type Editor is a WordPress plugin.

I lets you customise (override) the text labels for any registered custom post type using a simple Dashboard user interface. No PHP file editing is necessary!

This plugin is published in the [WordPress.org plugins repository](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cpt-editor/)

See the readme.txt file for more information.
